## A simple Persian text summarizer 
Text summarization is one of the most widely used projects in natural language processing (NLP). It is crucial because the key phrases, important sentences, useful information, and the main concept of the text are detected during the summarization process. This project is a simple text summarizer for anyone who wants to learn Persain NLP.
## Text summarization approaches
It is worth mentioning that text summarization is an unsupervised problem. There are two approaches to solving this problem: the first is the "extractive" policy in which similar sentences are weighted and sentences with higher ranks are selected. The second approach is called "abstractive", which is more complex. It refers to methods for understanding context and creates its summary with new sentences that may not even use in the document. In this project, the focus is on the extractive approach, based on "text rank algorithm".
## Usage
There are three sample files that contain news from Iranian news agencies. You can run Extractive.py with one of these samples. The file "stopwords" must be moved in the current directory.
